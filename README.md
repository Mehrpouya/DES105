# The Spongebob project
## Developed by DES105 class 2024

### Here we document our thinking and design process:
Idea: We are developing a gamified experience around being a sponge. We start by using Spongebob as our main character. 
We came up with some design excitements and limitations for our project. 
**Limitations are:**
- No in game UI
- Limited vision
- No micro transaction
- You get an add every 4 seconds
**Excitements/affirdance are:**
- Becoming sponge, how to sense like a sponge
- Movement mechanics based on parasitic behaviours
- Give a sense of scale, of being small and reliant
- Breathing mechanic
- Aesthetics of Sponge bobby
- The more you play the more environment gets dark

## What is a sponge
- Rarely found completely free-floating.
- adapts well to its habitat, 
  - live on hard/rocky surfaces & soft sediments/sand and mud.
- tiny hairlike structures called flagella create currents to filter bacteria out of the sponge’s cells and trap food within them. 
- strong skeletal structures help sponges withstand the high volume of water that flows through them each day![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e739c0ea-754f-4bb6-8269-6bb7e670276f)

1. As water filters through a sponge
2. the sponge gains some motion
3. Receives food and oxygen
4. dispels waste
